### 1. ATM System (C++)
   - **Description**: This project simulates an ATM machine with functionalities like withdrawing cash, checking balances, and depositing money. It uses C++ collection data types such as arrays and vectors for managing accounts and transactions.
   - **Technologies Used**: C++, Arrays, Vectors.
   - **Skills**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures.
   - [Atm](./ATM-System-Cpp)
